<img src="../images/manti.jpg">
<p>Manti is a Turkish traditional dish which is made with ground meat and dough. Mostly manti is served as a piece de resistance at a restaurant. Manti is made with tiny dough balls which have meat inside and it's served with yogurt and special sauces. I'm very excited to share the recipe of manti with you.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <strong>Dough:</strong>
        <ul>

            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon water, or as needed</li>
        </ul>
        <strong>Filling</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>2 onions.peeled</li>
            <li>½ pound ground beef</li>
            <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>  
        <strong>Red Pepper Oil</strong>  
        <ul>
            <li>3 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon red pepper flakes</li>
        </ul>
        <strong>Yogurt Sauces</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (8 ounce) container plain yogurt</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic</li>
        </ul>
<h2>Directions</h2>  
        <ol>
            <li>Make dough: Combine flour and salt in a large bowl. Add eggs and water, mixing well with your hands. Add more water, if needed, to form a soft dough. Cover and set aside for at least 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Make filling: Shred onions and place them in a colander or sieve set over a bowl; drain and discard juice. Combine drained onion, ground beef, salt, and pepper in a medium bowl; mix well with a spoon until mashed. Set filling aside.</li>
            <li>Lightly flour a work surface and a large plate.</li>
            <li>Divide dough in half. Working with one piece at a time, roll dough on the floured surface into a rectangle as thin as possible. Cut into 2-inch squares using a knife or pastry wheel.</li>
            <li>Place about 2 teaspoons filling in the center of each square. Gather the edges of dough and pinch them together at the top to form a bundle. Transfer manti to the prepared plate; sprinkle more flour on top to prevent sticking.</li>
            <li>Make oil: Heat oil and red pepper flakes in a small skillet over low heat just until pepper flakes begin to color oil. Remove from heat and keep warm.</li>
            <li>Make sauce: Stir together yogurt and garlic in a small bowl; set aside.</li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over medium-high heat. Cook manti in boiling water until filling is no longer pink and dough is tender, 20 to 25 minutes. Drain well.</li>
            <li>Divide manti onto 4 plates. Spoon yogurt sauce over manti and drizzle with pepper oil.</li>
        </ol>
